        The <strong>GIVE YOUR LIFE. DONâ€™T TAKE IT</strong> approach targets
        those who have lost hope due to external circumstances. Obviously,
        breaking through suicidal despair is a daunting task. Yet, for those who
        hide their pain and intent, the odds of breaking through the fatal
        mental agony is nearly impossible.
